<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><EM>Beowulf is the oldest epic in English. Drawing from Danish history and 
  folk tales, it was composed, probably in the early 8th century,. by a 
  Northumbrian poet. The <A 
  href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/beowulf-oe.html">Klaeber 
  edition</A> of the Old English text is also online.</EM> </P>
  <P><STRONG><BR>PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE </STRONG></P>
  <P>LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings<BR>of spear-armed Danes, in days 
  long sped,<BR>we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!<BR>Oft Scyld 
  the Scefing from squadroned foes,<BR>from many a tribe, the mead-bench 
  tore,<BR>awing the earls. Since erst he lay<BR>friendless, a foundling, fate 
  repaid him:<BR>for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,<BR>till before 
  him the folk, both far and near,<BR>who house by the whale-path, heard his 
  mandate,<BR>gave him gifts: a good king he!<BR>To him an heir was afterward 
  born,<BR>a son in his halls, whom heaven sent<BR>to favor the folk, feeling 
  their woe<BR>that erst they had lacked an earl for leader<BR>so long a while; 
  the Lord endowed him,<BR>the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.<BR>Famed 
  was this Beowulf:[1] far flew the boast of him,<BR>son of Scyld, in the 
  Scandian lands.<BR>So becomes it a youth to quit him well<BR>with his father's 
  friends, by fee and gift,<BR>that to aid him, aged, in after days,<BR>come 
  warriors willing, should war draw nigh,<BR>liegemen loyal: by lauded 
  deeds<BR>shall an earl have honor in every clan.<BR>Forth he fared at the 
  fated moment,<BR>sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.<BR>Then they bore him 
  over to ocean's billow,<BR>loving clansmen, as late he charged them,<BR>while 
  wielded words the winsome Scyld,<BR>the leader beloved who long had 
  ruled....<BR>In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,<BR>ice-flecked, 
  outbound, atheling's barge:<BR>there laid they down their darling lord<BR>on 
  the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,[2]<BR>by the mast the mighty 
  one. Many a treasure<BR>fetched from far was freighted with him.<BR>No ship 
  have I known so nobly dight<BR>with weapons of war and weeds of 
  battle,<BR>with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay<BR>a heaped hoard that 
  hence should go<BR>far o'er the flood with him floating away.<BR>No less these 
  loaded the lordly gifts,<BR>thanes' huge treasure, than those had done<BR>who 
  in former time forth had sent him<BR>sole on the seas, a suckling 
  child.<BR>High o'er his head they hoist the standard,<BR>a gold-wove banner; 
  let billows take him,<BR>gave him to ocean. Grave were their 
  spirits,<BR>mournful their mood. No man is able<BR>to say in sooth, no son of 
  the halls,<BR>no hero 'neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight! </P>

  <P>I </P>
  <P>Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,<BR>leader beloved, and long 
  he ruled<BR>in fame with all folk, since his father had gone<BR>away from the 
  world, till awoke an heir,<BR>haughty Healfdene, who held through 
  life,<BR>sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.<BR>Then, one after one, there 
  woke to him,<BR>to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:<BR>Heorogar, then 
  Hrothgar, then Halga brave;<BR>and I heard that -- was --'s queen,<BR>the 
  Heathoscylfing's helpmate dear.<BR>To Hrothgar was given such glory of 
  war,<BR>such honor of combat, that all his kin<BR>obeyed him gladly till great 
  grew his band<BR>of youthful comrades. It came in his mind<BR>to bid his 
  henchmen a hall uprear,<BR>a master mead-house, mightier far<BR>than ever was 
  seen by the sons of earth,<BR>and within it, then, to old and young<BR>he 
  would all allot that the Lord had sent him,<BR>save only the land and the 
  lives of his men.<BR>Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,<BR>for many a 
  tribe this mid-earth round,<BR>to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he 
  ordered,<BR>in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,<BR>of halls the 
  noblest: Heorot[1] he named it<BR>whose message had might in many a 
  land.<BR>Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,<BR>treasure at banquet: 
  there towered the hall,<BR>high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting<BR>of 
  furious flame.[2] Nor far was that day<BR>when father and son-in-law stood in 
  feud<BR>for warfare and hatred that woke again.[3]</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With envy and anger an evil spirit<BR>endured the 
  dole in his dark abode,<BR>that he heard each day the din of revel<BR>high in 
  the hall: there harps rang out,<BR>clear song of the singer. He sang who 
  knew[4]<BR>tales of the early time of man,<BR>how the Almighty made the 
  earth,<BR>fairest fields enfolded by water,<BR>set, triumphant, sun and 
  moon<BR>for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,<BR>and braided bright the 
  breast of earth<BR>with limbs and leaves, made life for all<BR>of mortal 
  beings that breathe and move.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel<BR>a 
  winsome life, till one began<BR>to fashion evils, that field of 
  hell.<BR>Grendel this monster grim was called,<BR>march-riever[5] mighty, in 
  moorland living,<BR>in fen and fastness; fief of the giants<BR>the hapless 
  wight a while had kept<BR>since the Creator his exile doomed.<BR>On kin of 
  Cain was the killing avenged<BR>by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.<BR>Ill 
  fared his feud,[6] and far was he driven,<BR>for the slaughter's sake, from 
  sight of men.<BR>Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,<BR>Etins[7] and elves and 
  evil-spirits,<BR>as well as the giants that warred with God<BR>weary while: 
  but their wage was paid them! </P>

    <P><SMALL><EM>[1] That is, "The Hart," or "Stag," so called from decorations 
    in the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer. This hall has been 
    carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne. The building was rectangular, 
    with opposite doors -- mainly west and east -- and a hearth in the middle of 
    the single room. A row of pillars down each side, at some distance from the 
    walls, made a space which was raised a little above the main floor, and was 
    furnished with two rows of seats. On one side, usually south, was the 
    high-seat midway between the doors. Opposite this, on the other raised 
    space, was another seat of honor. At the banquet soon to be described, 
    Hrothgar sat in the south or chief high-seat, and Beowulf opposite to him. 
    The scene for a flying (see below, v.499) was thus very effectively set. 
    Planks on trestles -- the "board" of later English literature -- formed the 
    tables just in front of the long rows of seats, and were taken away after 
    banquets, when the retainers were ready to stretch themselves out for sleep 
    on the benches.</SMALL><BR><SMALL>[2] Fire was the usual end of these halls. 
    See v. 781 below. One thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the 
    Nibelungen, of the Nialssaga, of Saxo's story of Amlethus, and many a less 
    famous instance.<BR>[3] It is to be supposed that all hearers of this poem 
    knew how Hrothgar's hall was burnt, -- perhaps in the unsuccessful attack 
    made on him by his son-in-law Ingeld.<BR>[4] A skilled minstrel. The Danes 
    are heathens, as one is told presently; but this lay of beginnings is taken 
    from Genesis.<BR>[5] A disturber of the border, one who sallies from his 
    haunt in the fen and roams over the country near by. This probably pagan 
    nuisance is now furnished with biblical credentials as a fiend or devil in 
    good standing, so that all Christian Englishmen might read about him. 
    "Grendel" may mean one who grinds and crushes.<BR>[6] Cain's.<BR>[7] 
    Giants.</EM></SMALL></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>WENT he forth to find at fall of night<BR>that haughty house, and heed 
  wherever<BR>the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.<BR>Found within it 
  the atheling band<BR>asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,<BR>of human 
  hardship. Unhallowed wight,<BR>grim and greedy, he grasped 
  betimes,<BR>wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,<BR>thirty of the thanes, 
  and thence he rushed<BR>fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,<BR>laden with 
  slaughter, his lair to seek.<BR>Then at the dawning, as day was 
  breaking,<BR>the might of Grendel to men was known;<BR>then after wassail was 
  wail uplifted,<BR>loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,<BR>atheling 
  excellent, unblithe sat,<BR>labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,<BR>when 
  once had been traced the trail of the fiend,<BR>spirit accurst: too cruel that 
  sorrow,<BR>too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;<BR>with night 
  returning, anew began<BR>ruthless murder; he recked no whit,<BR>firm in his 
  guilt, of the feud and crime.<BR>They were easy to find who elsewhere 
  sought<BR>in room remote their rest at night,<BR>bed in the bowers,[1] when 
  that bale was shown,<BR>was seen in sooth, with surest token, --<BR>the 
  hall-thane's[2] hate. Such held themselves<BR>far and fast who the fiend 
  outran!<BR>Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill<BR>one against all; until 
  empty stood<BR>that lordly building, and long it bode so.<BR>Twelve years' 
  tide the trouble he bore,<BR>sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in 
  plenty,<BR>boundless cares. There came unhidden<BR>tidings true to the tribes 
  of men,<BR>in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel<BR>harassed Hrothgar, 
  what hate he bore him,<BR>what murder and massacre, many a year,<BR>feud 
  unfading, -- refused consent<BR>to deal with any of Daneland's earls,<BR>make 
  pact of peace, or compound for gold:<BR>still less did the wise men ween to 
  get<BR>great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.<BR>But the evil one 
  ambushed old and young<BR>death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,<BR>lured, 
  or lurked in the livelong night<BR>of misty moorlands: men may say 
  not<BR>where the haunts of these Hell-Runes[3] be.<BR>Such heaping of horrors 
  the hater of men,<BR>lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,<BR>harassings heavy. 
  O'er Heorot he lorded,<BR>gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;<BR>and ne'er 
  could the prince[4] approach his throne,<BR>-- 'twas judgment of God, -- or 
  have joy in his hall.<BR>Sore was the sorrow to 
  Scyldings'-friend,<BR>heart-rending misery. Many nobles<BR>sat assembled, and 
  searched out counsel<BR>how it were best for bold-hearted men<BR>against 
  harassing terror to try their hand.<BR>Whiles they vowed in their heathen 
  fanes<BR>altar-offerings, asked with words[5]<BR>that the slayer-of-souls 
  would succor give them<BR>for the pain of their people. Their practice 
  this,<BR>their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of<BR>in mood of their 
  mind. Almighty they knew not,<BR>Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,<BR>nor 
  Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,<BR>Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that 
  man<BR>who in harm and hatred hales his soul<BR>to fiery embraces; -- nor 
  favor nor change<BR>awaits he ever. But well for him<BR>that after death-day 
  may draw to his Lord,<BR>and friendship find in the Father's arms! </P>

  <P>THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene<BR>with the woe of these days; 
  not wisest men<BR>assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,<BR>loathly and 
  long, that lay on his folk,<BR>most baneful of burdens and bales of the night. 
  </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This heard in his home Hygelac's thane,<BR>great among 
  Geats, of Grendel's doings.<BR>He was the mightiest man of valor<BR>in that 
  same day of this our life,<BR>stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker<BR>he 
  bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,<BR>far o'er the swan-road he fain 
  would seek,<BR>the noble monarch who needed men!<BR>The prince's journey by 
  prudent folk<BR>was little blamed, though they loved him dear;<BR>they whetted 
  the hero, and hailed good omens.<BR>And now the bold one from bands of 
  Geats<BR>comrades chose, the keenest of warriors<BR>e'er he could find; with 
  fourteen men<BR>the sea-wood[1] he sought, and, sailor proved,<BR>led them on 
  to the land's confines.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time had now flown;[2] afloat was the ship,<BR>boat 
  under bluff. On board they climbed,<BR>warriors ready; waves were 
  churning<BR>sea with sand; the sailors bore<BR>on the breast of the bark their 
  bright array,<BR>their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,<BR>on its willing 
  way, the well-braced craft.<BR>Then moved o'er the waters by might of the 
  wind<BR>that bark like a bird with breast of foam,<BR>till in season due, on 
  the second day,<BR>the curved prow such course had run<BR>that sailors now 
  could see the land,<BR>sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,<BR>headlands 
  broad. Their haven was found,<BR>their journey ended. Up then quickly<BR>the 
  Weders'[3] clansmen climbed ashore,<BR>anchored their sea-wood, with armor 
  clashing<BR>and gear of battle: God they thanked<BR>for passing in peace o'er 
  the paths of the sea.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,<BR>a 
  warden that watched the water-side,<BR>how they bore o'er the gangway 
  glittering shields,<BR>war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him<BR>to know 
  what manner of men they were.<BR>Straight to the strand his steed he 
  rode,<BR>Hrothgar's henchman; with hand of might<BR>he shook his spear, and 
  spake in parley.<BR>"Who are ye, then, ye armed men,<BR>mailed folk, that yon 
  mighty vessel<BR>have urged thus over the ocean ways,<BR>here o'er the waters? 
  A warden I,<BR>sentinel set o'er the sea-march here,<BR>lest any foe to the 
  folk of Danes<BR>with harrying fleet should harm the land.<BR>No aliens ever 
  at ease thus bore them,<BR>linden-wielders:[4] yet word-of-leave<BR>clearly ye 
  lack from clansmen here,<BR>my folk's agreement. -- A greater ne'er saw 
  I<BR>of warriors in world than is one of you, --<BR>yon hero in harness! No 
  henchman he<BR>worthied by weapons, if witness his features,<BR>his peerless 
  presence! I pray you, though, tell<BR>your folk and home, lest hence ye 
  fare<BR>suspect to wander your way as spies<BR>in Danish land. Now, dwellers 
  afar,<BR>ocean-travellers, take from me<BR>simple advice: the sooner the 
  better<BR>I hear of the country whence ye came." </P>

  all.<BR>To thy lord and liege in loyal mood<BR>we hasten hither, to 
  Healfdene's son,<BR>people-protector: be pleased to advise us!<BR>To that 
  mighty-one come we on mickle errand,<BR>to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I 
  right<BR>that aught be hidden. We hear -- thou knowest<BR>if sooth it is -- 
  the saying of men,<BR>that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,<BR>dark 
  ill-doer, in dusky nights<BR>shows terrific his rage unmatched,<BR>hatred and 
  murder. To Hrothgar I<BR>in greatness of soul would succor bring,<BR>so the 
  Wise-and-Brave[1] may worst his foes, --<BR>if ever the end of ills is 
  fated,<BR>of cruel contest, if cure shall follow,<BR>and the boiling 
  care-waves cooler grow;<BR>else ever afterward anguish-days<BR>he shall suffer 
  in sorrow while stands in place<BR>high on its hill that house 
  unpeered!"<BR>Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered,<BR>clansman 
  unquailing: "The keen-souled thane<BR>must be skilled to sever and sunder 
  duly<BR>words and works, if he well intends.<BR>I gather, this band is 
  graciously bent<BR>to the Scyldings' master. March, then, bearing<BR>weapons 
  and weeds the way I show you.<BR>I will bid my men your boat meanwhile<BR>to 
  guard for fear lest foemen come, --<BR>your new-tarred ship by shore of 
  ocean<BR>faithfully watching till once again<BR>it waft o'er the waters those 
  well-loved thanes,<BR>-- winding-neck'd wood, -- to Weders' bounds,<BR>heroes 
  such as the hest of fate<BR>shall succor and save from the shock of 
  war."<BR>They bent them to march, -- the boat lay still,<BR>fettered by cable 
  and fast at anchor,<BR>broad-bosomed ship. -- Then shone the boars[2]<BR>over 
  the cheek-guard; chased with gold,<BR>keen and gleaming, guard it kept<BR>o'er 
  the man of war, as marched along<BR>heroes in haste, till the hall they 
  saw,<BR>broad of gable and bright with gold:<BR>that was the fairest, 'mid 
  folk of earth,<BR>of houses 'neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,<BR>and the 
  gleam of it lightened o'er lands afar.<BR>The sturdy shieldsman showed that 
  bright<BR>burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go<BR>straightway thither; his steed 
  then turned,<BR>hardy hero, and hailed them thus:--<BR>"Tis time that I fare 
  from you. Father Almighty<BR>in grace and mercy guard you well,<BR>safe in

  combat[1] a feud enkindled<BR>when Heatholaf with hand he slew<BR>among the 
  Wylfings; his Weder kin<BR>for horror of fighting feared to hold

  <P>UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,<BR>who sat at the feet of the Scyldings'

  seafarer's, sorely galled him;<BR>ever he envied that other men<BR>should more 
  achieve in middle-earth<BR>of fame under heaven than he himself. --<BR>"Art 
  thou that Beowulf, Breca's rival,<BR>who emulous swam on the open sea,<BR>when 
  for pride the pair of you proved the floods,<BR>and wantonly dared in waters 
  deep<BR>to risk your lives? No living man,<BR>or lief or loath, from your 
  labor dire<BR>could you dissuade, from swimming the main.<BR>Ocean-tides with 
  your arms ye covered,<BR>with strenuous hands the sea-streets 
  measured,<BR>swam o'er the waters. Winter's storm<BR>rolled the rough waves. 
  In realm of sea<BR>a sennight strove ye. In swimming he topped thee,<BR>had 
  more of main! Him at morning-tide<BR>billows bore to the Battling 
  Reamas,<BR>whence he hied to his home so dear<BR>beloved of his liegemen, to 
  land of Brondings,<BR>fastness fair, where his folk he ruled,<BR>town and 
  treasure. In triumph o'er thee<BR>Beanstan's bairn[2] his boast 
  achieved.<BR>So ween I for thee a worse adventure<BR>-- though in buffet of

  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>"What a deal 
  hast uttered, dear my Unferth,<BR>drunken with beer, of Breca now,<BR>told of 
  his triumph! Truth I claim it,<BR>that I had more of might in the sea<BR>than 
  any man else, more ocean-endurance.<BR>We twain had talked, in time of 
  youth,<BR>and made our boast, -- we were merely boys,<BR>striplings still, -- 
  to stake our lives<BR>far at sea: and so we performed it.<BR>Naked swords, as 
  we swam along,<BR>we held in hand, with hope to guard us<BR>against the 
  whales. Not a whit from me<BR>could he float afar o'er the flood of

  the tides abode<BR>five nights full till the flood divided us,<BR>churning 
  waves and chillest weather,<BR>darkling night, and the northern 
  wind<BR>ruthless rushed on us: rough was the surge.<BR>Now the wrath of the 
  sea-fish rose apace;<BR>yet me 'gainst the monsters my mailed coat,<BR>hard 
  and hand-linked, help afforded, --<BR>battle-sark braided my breast to

  the hated foe,<BR>with grimmest gripe. 'Twas granted me, though,<BR>to pierce

  <P>ME thus often the evil monsters<BR>thronging threatened. With thrust of my 
  sword,<BR>the darling, I dealt them due return!<BR>Nowise had they bliss from 
  their booty then<BR>to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,<BR>seated to 
  banquet at bottom of sea;<BR>but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,<BR>on 
  the edge of ocean up they lay,<BR>put to sleep by the sword. And since, by 
  them<BR>on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk<BR>are never molested. -- Light 
  from east,<BR>came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,<BR>so that I saw the 
  sea-cliffs high,<BR>windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth<BR>earl undoomed if he 
  doughty be!<BR>And so it came that I killed with my sword<BR>nine of the 
  nicors. Of night-fought battles<BR>ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's 
  dome,<BR>nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!<BR>Yet I came unharmed 
  from that hostile clutch,<BR>though spent with swimming. The sea upbore 
  me,<BR>flood of the tide, on Finnish land,<BR>the welling waters. No wise of 
  thee<BR>have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,<BR>bitter battle. 
  Breca ne'er yet,<BR>not one of you pair, in the play of war<BR>such daring 
  deed has done at all<BR>with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --<BR>though 
  thou wast the bane[1] of thy brethren dear,<BR>thy closest kin, whence curse 
  of hell<BR>awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!<BR>For I say in sooth, thou 
  son of Ecglaf,<BR>never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,<BR>monster dire, 
  on thy master dear,<BR>in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine<BR>were as 
  battle-bold as thy boast is loud!<BR>But he has found no feud will 
  happen;<BR>from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan<BR>he vaunts him safe, 
  from the Victor-Scyldings.<BR>He forces pledges, favors none<BR>of the land of 
  Danes, but lustily murders,<BR>fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads<BR>from 
  Spear-Dane men. But speedily now<BR>shall I prove him the prowess and pride of 
  the Geats,<BR>shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead<BR>go he that listeth, when

  from the south shall beam!"</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,<BR>hoar-haired, 
  war-brave; help awaited<BR>the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf 
  hearing,<BR>folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.<BR>Then was laughter of 
  liegemen loud resounding<BR>with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow 
  forth,<BR>queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,<BR>gold-decked, greeting the 
  guests in hall;<BR>and the high-born lady handed the cup<BR>first to the 
  East-Danes' heir and warden,<BR>bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,<BR>the 
  land's beloved one. Lustily took he<BR>banquet and beaker, battle-famed 
  king.<BR>Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,<BR>to younger and 
  older everywhere<BR>carried the cup, till come the moment<BR>when the 
  ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,<BR>to Beowulf bore the beaker of 
  mead.<BR>She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,<BR>in wisdom's words, 
  that her will was granted,<BR>that at last on a hero her hope could 
  lean<BR>for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,<BR>hardy-in-war, from 
  Wealhtheow's hand,<BR>and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.<BR>Beowulf 
  spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>"This was my thought, when my thanes and 
  I<BR>bent to the ocean and entered our boat,<BR>that I would work the will of 
  your people<BR>fully, or fighting fall in death,<BR>in fiend's gripe fast. I 
  am firm to do<BR>an earl's brave deed, or end the days<BR>of this life of mine 
  in the mead-hall here."<BR>Well these words to the woman seemed,<BR>Beowulf's 
  battle-boast. -- Bright with gold<BR>the stately dame by her spouse sat 
  down.<BR>Again, as erst, began in hall<BR>warriors' wassail and words of 
  power,<BR>the proud-band's revel, till presently<BR>the son of Healfdene 
  hastened to seek<BR>rest for the night; he knew there waited<BR>fight for the 
  fiend in that festal hall,<BR>when the sheen of the sun they saw no 
  more,<BR>and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,<BR>and shadowy shapes came 
  striding on,<BR>wan under welkin. The warriors rose.<BR>Man to man, he made 
  harangue,<BR>Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,<BR>let him wield the wine 
  hall: a word he added:--<BR>"Never to any man erst I trusted,<BR>since I could 
  heave up hand and shield,<BR>this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.<BR>Have

  <P>THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,<BR>defence-of-Scyldings, forth from 
  hall;<BR>fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,<BR>couch of his queen. The 
  King-of-Glory<BR>against this Grendel a guard had set,<BR>so heroes heard, a 
  hall-defender,<BR>who warded the monarch and watched for the monster.<BR>In 
  truth, the Geats' prince gladly trusted<BR>his mettle, his might, the mercy of 
  God!<BR>Cast off then his corselet of iron,<BR>helmet from head; to his 
  henchman gave, --<BR>choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,<BR>bidding 
  him guard the gear of battle.<BR>Spake then his Vaunt the valiant 
  man,<BR>Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought:--<BR>"Of force in fight no 
  feebler I count me,<BR>in grim war-deeds, than Grendel deems him.<BR>Not with 
  the sword, then, to sleep of death<BR>his life will I give, though it lie in

  if he seek me here,<BR>unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,<BR>sacred Lord, on

  chieftain, and cheek-pillows held<BR>the head of the earl, while all about 
  him<BR>seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.<BR>None of them thought that thence 
  their steps<BR>to the folk and fastness that fostered them,<BR>to the land

  many<BR>battle-death seized, in the banquet-hall,<BR>of Danish clan. But

  Thro' wan night striding,<BR>came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors

  widely known<BR>that against God's will the ghostly ravager<BR>him[1] could 
  not hurl to haunts of darkness;<BR>wakeful, ready, with warrior's

  <P>XI </P>
  <P>THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,<BR>with God's wrath laden, Grendel 
  came.<BR>The monster was minded of mankind now<BR>sundry to seize in the 
  stately house.<BR>Under welkin he walked, till the wine-palace 
  there,<BR>gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,<BR>flashing with fretwork. 
  Not first time, this,<BR>that he the home of Hrothgar sought, --<BR>yet ne'er 
  in his life-day, late or early,<BR>such hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, 
  found!<BR>To the house the warrior walked apace,<BR>parted from peace;[1] the 
  portal opended,<BR>though with forged bolts fast, when his fists 
  had&nbsp;struck it,<BR>and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,<BR>the 
  house's mouth. All hastily, then,<BR>o'er fair-paved floor the fiend trod 
  on,<BR>ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes<BR>fearful flashes, like 
  flame to see.<BR>He spied in hall the hero-band,<BR>kin and clansmen clustered 
  asleep,<BR>hardy liegemen. Then laughed his heart;<BR>for the monster was 
  minded, ere morn should dawn,<BR>savage, to sever the soul of each,<BR>life 
  from body, since lusty banquet<BR>waited his will! But Wyrd forbade him<BR>to 
  seize any more of men on earth<BR>after that evening. Eagerly 
  watched<BR>Hygelac's kinsman his cursed foe,<BR>how he would fare in fell 
  attack.<BR>Not that the monster was minded to pause!<BR>Straightway he seized 
  a sleeping warrior<BR>for the first, and tore him fiercely asunder,<BR>the 
  bone-frame bit, drank blood in streams,<BR>swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly 
  thus<BR>the lifeless corse was clear devoured,<BR>e'en feet and hands. Then 
  farther he hied;<BR>for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,<BR>felt for the 
  foe with fiendish claw,<BR>for the hero reclining, -- who clutched it 
  boldly,<BR>prompt to answer, propped on his arm.<BR>Soon then saw that 
  shepherd-of-evils<BR>that never he met in this middle-world,<BR>in the ways of 
  earth, another wight<BR>with heavier hand-gripe; at heart he 
  feared,<BR>sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!<BR>Fain would he 
  flee, his fastness seek,<BR>the den of devils: no doings now<BR>such as oft he 
  had done in days of old!</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bethought him the hardy Hygelac-thane<BR>of 
  his boast at evening: up he bounded,<BR>grasped firm his foe, whose fingers 
  cracked.<BR>The fiend made off, but the earl close followed.<BR>The monster 
  meant -- if he might at all --<BR>to fling himself free, and far away<BR>fly 
  to the fens, -- knew his fingers' power<BR>in the gripe of the grim one. 
  Gruesome march<BR>to Heorot this monster of harm had made!<BR>Din filled the 
  room; the Danes were bereft,<BR>castle-dwellers and clansmen all,<BR>earls, of 
  their ale. Angry were both<BR>those savage hall-guards: the house 
  resounded.<BR>Wonder it was the wine-hall firm<BR>in the strain of their 
  struggle stood, to earth<BR>the fair house fell not; too fast it was<BR>within 
  and without by its iron bands<BR>craftily clamped; though there crashed from 
  sill<BR>many a mead-bench -- men have told me --<BR>gay with gold, where the 
  grim foes wrestled.<BR>So well had weened the wisest Scyldings<BR>that not 
  ever at all might any man<BR>that bone-decked, brave house break 
  asunder,<BR>crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire<BR>in smoke engulfed it. 
  -- Again uprose<BR>din redoubled. Danes of the North<BR>with fear and frenzy 
  were filled, each one,<BR>who from the wall that wailing heard,<BR>God's foe 
  sounding his grisly song,<BR>cry of the conquered, clamorous pain<BR>from 
  captive of hell. Too closely held him<BR>he who of men in might was 
  strongest<BR>in that same day of this our life. </P>

  <P>NOT in any wise would the earls'-defence[1]<BR>suffer that slaughterous 
  stranger to live,<BR>useless deeming his days and years<BR>to men on earth. 
  Now many an earl<BR>of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral,<BR>fain the life of 
  their lord to shield,<BR>their praised prince, if power were theirs;<BR>never 
  they knew, -- as they neared the foe,<BR>hardy-hearted heroes of 
  war,<BR>aiming their swords on every side<BR>the accursed to kill, -- no 
  keenest blade,<BR>no farest of falchions fashioned on earth,<BR>could harm or 
  hurt that hideous fiend!<BR>He was safe, by his spells, from sword of 
  battle,<BR>from edge of iron. Yet his end and parting<BR>on that same day of 
  this our life<BR>woful should be, and his wandering soul<BR>far off flit to 
  the fiends' domain.<BR>Soon he found, who in former days,<BR>harmful in heart 
  and hated of God,<BR>on many a man such murder wrought,<BR>that the frame of 
  his body failed him now.<BR>For him the keen-souled kinsman of Hygelac<BR>held 
  in hand; hateful alive<BR>was each to other. The outlaw dire<BR>took mortal 
  hurt; a mighty wound<BR>showed on his shoulder, and sinews cracked,<BR>and the 
  bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now<BR>the glory was given, and Grendel 
  thence<BR>death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,<BR>noisome abode: he 
  knew too well<BR>that here was the last of life, an end<BR>of his days on 
  earth. -- To all the Danes<BR>by that bloody battle the boon had come.<BR>From 
  ravage had rescued the roving stranger<BR>Hrothgar's hall; the hardy and wise 
  one<BR>had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,<BR>his deed and its 
  honor. To Eastern Danes<BR>had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good,<BR>all 
  their sorrow and ills assuaged,<BR>their bale of battle borne so long,<BR>and 
  all the dole they erst endured<BR>pain a-plenty. -- 'Twas proof of 
  this,<BR>when the hardy-in-fight a hand laid down,<BR>arm and shoulder, -- 
  all, indeed,<BR>of Grendel's gripe, -- 'neath the gabled roof· </P>

  <P>XIII </P>
  <P>MANY at morning, as men have told me,<BR>warriors gathered the gift-hall 
  round,<BR>folk-leaders faring from far and near,<BR>o'er wide-stretched ways, 
  the wonder to view,<BR>trace of the traitor. Not troublous seemed<BR>the 
  enemy's end to any man<BR>who saw by the gait of the graceless foe<BR>how the 
  weary-hearted, away from thence,<BR>baffled in battle and banned, his 
  steps<BR>death-marked dragged to the devils' mere.<BR>Bloody the billows were 
  boiling there,<BR>turbid the tide of tumbling waves<BR>horribly seething, with 
  sword-blood hot,<BR>by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the moor<BR>laid 
  forlorn his life adown,<BR>his heathen soul,-and hell received it.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home then rode the hoary clansmen<BR>from that 
  merry journey, and many a youth,<BR>on horses white, the hardy 
  warriors,<BR>back from the mere. Then Beowulf's glory<BR>eager they echoed, 
  and all averred<BR>that from sea to sea, or south or north,<BR>there was no 
  other in earth's domain,<BR>under vault of heaven, more valiant found,<BR>of 
  warriors none more worthy to rule!<BR>(On their lord beloved they laid no 
  slight,<BR>gracious Hrothgar: a good king he!)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the tried-in-battle<BR>their 
  gray steeds set to gallop amain,<BR>and ran a race when the road seemed 
  fair.<BR>From time to time, a thane of the king,<BR>who had made many vaunts, 
  and was mindful of verses,<BR>stored with sagas and songs of old,<BR>bound 
  word to word in well-knit rime,<BR>welded his lay; this warrior soon<BR>of 
  Beowulf's quest right cleverly sang,<BR>and artfully added an excellent 
  tale,<BR>in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds<BR>he had heard in saga of 
  Sigemund.<BR>Strange the story: he said it all, --<BR>the Waelsing's 
  wanderings wide, his struggles,<BR>which never were told to tribes of 
  men,<BR>the feuds and the frauds, save to Fitela only,<BR>when of these doings 
  he deigned to speak,<BR>uncle to nephew; as ever the twain<BR>stood side by 
  side in stress of war,<BR>and multitude of the monster kind<BR>they had felled 
  with their swords. Of Sigemund&nbsp;grew,<BR>when he passed from life, no 
  little praise;<BR>for the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed<BR>that herded the 
  hoard:[1] under hoary rock<BR>the atheling dared the deed alone<BR>fearful 
  quest, nor was Fitela there.<BR>Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced<BR>that 
  wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,<BR>best blade; the dragon died in its 
  blood.<BR>Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved<BR>over the ring-hoard to 
  rule at will,<BR>himself to pleasure; a sea-boat he loaded,<BR>and bore on its 
  bosom the beaming gold,<BR>son of Waels; the worm was consumed.<BR>He had of 
  all heroes the highest renown<BR>among races of men, this 
  refuge-of-warriors,<BR>for deeds of daring that decked his name<BR>since the 
  hand and heart of Heremod<BR>grew slack in battle. He, swiftly banished<BR>to 
  mingle with monsters at mercy of foes,<BR>to death was betrayed; for torrents 
  of sorrow<BR>had lamed him too long; a load of care<BR>to earls and athelings 
  all he proved.<BR>Oft indeed, in earlier days,<BR>for the warrior's wayfaring 
  wise men mourned,<BR>who had hoped of him help from harm and bale,<BR>and had 
  thought their sovran's son would thrive,<BR>follow his father, his folk 
  protect,<BR>the hoard and the stronghold, heroes' land,<BR>home of Scyldings.

  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And afresh to the race,[3] the fallow roads<BR>by

  <P>HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,<BR>stood by the steps, the steep

  see to the Sovran Ruler<BR>be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows<BR>I have 
  borne from Grendel; but God still works<BR>wonder on wonder, the 
  Warden-of-Glory.<BR>It was but now that I never more<BR>for woes that weighed 
  on me waited help<BR>long as I lived, when, laved in blood,<BR>stood 
  sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --<BR>widespread woe for wise men 
  all,<BR>who had no hope to hinder ever<BR>foes infernal and fiendish 
  sprites<BR>from havoc in hall. This hero now,<BR>by the Wielder's might, a 
  work has done<BR>that not all of us erst could ever do<BR>by wile and wisdom. 
  Lo, well can she say<BR>whoso of women this warrior bore<BR>among sons of men, 
  if still she liveth,<BR>that the God of the ages was good to her<BR>in the 
  birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,<BR>of heroes best, I shall heartily 
  love<BR>as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever<BR>this kinship new: thou 
  shalt never lack<BR>wealth of the world that I wield as mine!<BR>Full oft for 
  less have I largess showered,<BR>my precious hoard, on a punier man,<BR>less 
  stout in struggle. Thyself hast now<BR>fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame 
  shall endure<BR>through all the ages. As ever he did,<BR>well may the Wielder 
  reward thee still!"<BR>Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>"This work of 
  war most willingly<BR>we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly 
  dared<BR>force of the foe. Fain, too, were I<BR>hadst thou but seen himself, 
  what time<BR>the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!<BR>Swiftly, I 
  thought, in strongest gripe<BR>on his bed of death to bind him down,<BR>that 
  he in the hent of this hand of mine<BR>should breathe his last: but he broke 
  away.<BR>Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --<BR>hinder from flight, and 
  firm enough hold<BR>the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,<BR>the ruthless, in 
  running! For rescue, however,<BR>he left behind him his hand in pledge,<BR>arm 
  and shoulder; nor aught of help<BR>could the cursed one thus procure at 
  all.<BR>None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,<BR>sunk in his sins, but 
  sorrow holds him<BR>tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,<BR>in baleful bonds,

  <P>THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now<BR>for hands to bedeck it, and dense 
  was the throng<BR>of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,<BR>the guest-room 
  to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings<BR>that were wove on the wall, and 
  wonders many<BR>to delight each mortal that looks upon them.<BR>Though braced 
  within by iron bands,<BR>that building bright was broken sorely;[1]<BR>rent 
  were its hinges; the roof alone<BR>held safe and sound, when, seared with

  who sat in the sumptuous hall,<BR>Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now<BR>was 
  filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings<BR>ne'er yet had tried the 
  traitor's deed.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene<BR>a 
  gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,<BR>broidered battle-flag, breastplate 
  and helmet;<BR>and a splendid sword was seen of many<BR>borne to the brave 
  one. Beowulf took<BR>cup in hall:[2] for such costly gifts<BR>he suffered no 
  shame in that soldier throng.<BR>For I heard of few heroes, in heartier 
  mood,<BR>with four such gifts, so fashioned with gold,<BR>on the ale-bench 
  honoring others thus!<BR>O'er the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,<BR>wound 
  with wires, kept ward o'er the head,<BR>lest the relict-of-files[3] should 
  fierce invade,<BR>sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero<BR>should go to 
  grapple against his foes.<BR>Then the earls'-defence[4] on the floor[5] bade 
  lead<BR>coursers eight, with carven head-gear,<BR>adown the hall: one horse 
  was decked<BR>with a saddle all shining and set in jewels;<BR>'twas the 
  battle-seat of the best of kings,<BR>when to play of swords the son of 
  Healfdene<BR>was fain to fare. Ne'er failed his valor<BR>in the crush of 
  combat when corpses fell.<BR>To Beowulf over them both then gave<BR>the 
  refuge-of-Ingwines right and power,<BR>o'er war-steeds and weapons: wished him

    willing hands prepared the banquet.<BR>[2] From its formal use in other

  <P>AND the lord of earls, to each that came<BR>with Beowulf over the briny

  song<BR>of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.[4]</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,<BR>was fated 
  to fall in the Frisian slaughter.[5]<BR>Hildeburh needed not hold in

  Hoc<BR>bewailed her doom when dawning came,<BR>and under the sky she saw them 
  lying,<BR>kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned<BR>of the sweets of the 
  world! By war were swept, too,<BR>Finn's own liegemen, and few were 
  left;<BR>in the parleying-place[7] he could ply no longer<BR>weapon, nor war 
  could he wage on Hengest,<BR>and rescue his remnant by right of arms<BR>from 
  the prince's thane. A pact he offered:<BR>another dwelling the Danes should 
  have,<BR>hall and high-seat, and half the power<BR>should fall to them in 
  Frisian land;<BR>and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son<BR>day by day the Danes 
  should honor,<BR>the folk of Hengest favor with rings,<BR>even as truly, with 
  treasure and jewels,<BR>with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin<BR>he meant to 
  honor in ale-hall there.<BR>Pact of peace they plighted further<BR>on both 
  sides firmly. Finn to Hengest<BR>with oath, upon honor, openly 
  promised<BR>that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid,<BR>nobly to govern, so 
  none of the guests<BR>by word or work should warp the treaty,[8]<BR>or with 
  malice of mind bemoan themselves<BR>as forced to follow their fee-giver's

  with foeman's taunt,<BR>that murderous hatred to mind recall,<BR>then edge of 
  the sword must seal his doom.<BR>Oaths were given, and ancient gold<BR>heaped 
  from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding,<BR>battle-thane best,[9] on his balefire

  pyre<BR>the bairn of her body on brands to lay,<BR>his bones to burn, on the 
  balefire placed,<BR>at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges<BR>bewept them

    <P><SMALL><EM>[1] Man-price, wergild.<BR>[2] Beowulf's.<BR>[3] 
    Hrothgar.<BR>[4] There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms. As before about 
    Sigemund and Heremod, so now, though at greater length, about Finn and his 
    feud, a lay is chanted or recited; and the epic poet, counting on his 
    readers' familiarity with the story, -- a fragment of it still exists, 
    --&nbsp; simply gives the headings.<BR>[5] The exact story to which this 
    episode refers in summary is not to be determined, but the following account 
    of it is reasonable and has good support among scholars. Finn, a Frisian 
    chieftain, who nevertheless has a "castle" outside the Frisian border, 
    marries Hildeburh, a Danish princess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many 
    other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations between the two peoples have been 
    strained before. Something starts the old feud anew; and the visitors are 
    attacked in their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is a son of Hildeburh. Many 
    fall on both sides. Peace is patched up; a stately funeral is held; and the 
    surviving visitors become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back 
    with him to Frisia. So matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the 
    Danes; but he is set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is 
    killed in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their home a 
    force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm Finn's stronghold, kill 
    him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh.<EM><BR></EM>[6] The "enemies" 
    must be the Frisians.<BR>[7] Battlefield. -- Hengest is the "prince's 
    thane," companion of Hnaef. "Folcwald's son" is Finn.<BR>[8] That is, Finn 
    would govern in all honor the few Danish warriors who were left, provided, 
    of course, that none of them tried to renew the quarrel or avenge Hnaef 
    their fallen lord. If, again, one of Finn's Frisians began a quarrel, he 
    should die by the sword.<BR>[9] Hnaef.<BR>[10] The high place chosen for the

  <P>THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,<BR>friendless, to find the 
  Frisian land,<BR>houses and high burg. Hengest still<BR>through the death-dyed 
  winter dwelt with Finn,<BR>holding pact, yet of home he minded,<BR>though 
  powerless his ring-decked prow to drive<BR>over the waters, now waves rolled 
  fierce<BR>lashed by the winds, or winter locked them<BR>in icy fetters. Then 
  fared another<BR>year to men's dwellings, as yet they do,<BR>the sunbright 
  skies, that their season ever<BR>duly await. Far off winter was 
  driven;<BR>fair lay earth's breast; and fain was the rover,<BR>the guest, to 
  depart, though more gladly he pondered<BR>on wreaking his vengeance than 
  roaming the deep,<BR>and how to hasten the hot encounter<BR>where sons of the 
  Frisians were sure to be.<BR>So he escaped not the common doom,<BR>when Hun 
  with "Lafing," the light-of-battle,<BR>best of blades, his bosom 
  pierced:<BR>its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.<BR>On fierce-heart Finn 
  there fell likewise,<BR>on himself at home, the horrid sword-death;<BR>for 
  Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack<BR>had sorrowing told, from sea-ways 
  landed,<BR>mourning their woes.[1] Finn's wavering spirit<BR>bode not in 
  breast. The burg was reddened<BR>with blood of foemen, and Finn was 
  slain,<BR>king amid clansmen; the queen was taken.<BR>To their ship the 
  Scylding warriors bore<BR>all the chattels the chieftain owned,<BR>whatever 
  they found in Finn's domain<BR>of gems and jewels. The gentle wife<BR>o'er 
  paths of the deep to the Danes they bore,<BR>led to her land.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lay was finished,<BR>the gleeman's song. Then 
  glad rose the revel;<BR>bench-joy brightened. Bearers draw<BR>from their 
  "wonder-vats" wine. Comes Wealhtheow forth,<BR>under gold-crown goes where the 
  good pair sit,<BR>uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,<BR>kindred in 
  amity. Unferth the spokesman<BR>at the Scylding lord's feet sat: men had faith 
  in his spirit,<BR>his keenness of courage, though kinsmen had found 
  him<BR>unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen spoke:<BR>"Quaff of this 
  cup, my king and lord,<BR>breaker of rings, and blithe be thou,<BR>gold-friend 
  of men; to the Geats here speak<BR>such words of mildness as man should 
  use.<BR>Be glad with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,<BR>or near or far,

  guarded that golden hall,<BR>evil wrought, till his end drew 
  nigh,<BR>slaughter for sins. 'Twas seen and told<BR>how an avenger survived 
  the fiend,<BR>as was learned afar. The livelong time<BR>after that grim fight,

  dwell in the dreary waters,<BR>cold sea-courses, since Cain cut down<BR>with

  grisly one grappled amain.<BR>But the man remembered his mighty power,<BR>the 
  glorious gift that God had sent him,<BR>in his Maker's mercy put his 
  trust<BR>for comfort and help: so he conquered the foe,<BR>felled the fiend, 
  who fled abject,<BR>reft of joy, to the realms of death,<BR>mankind's foe. And 
  his mother now,<BR>gloomy and grim, would go that quest<BR>of sorrow, the 
  death of her son to avenge.<BR>To Heorot came she, where helmeted 
  Danes<BR>slept in the hall. Too soon came back<BR>old ills of the earls, when 
  in she burst,<BR>the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that 
  terror,<BR>e'en as terror of woman in war is less,<BR>might of maid, than of

  is their home;<BR>by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,<BR>fenways 
  fearful, where flows the stream<BR>from mountains gliding to gloom of the

  <P>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:<BR>"Sorrow not, sage! It beseems us 
  better<BR>friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<BR>Each of us all 
  must his end abide<BR>in the ways of the world; so win who may<BR>glory ere 
  death! When his days are told,<BR>that is the warrior's worthiest 
  doom.<BR>Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<BR>and mark the trail of the 
  mother of Grendel.<BR>No harbor shall hide her -- heed my promise! 
  --<BR>enfolding of field or forested mountain<BR>or floor of the flood, let 
  her flee where she will!<BR>But thou this day endure in patience,<BR>as I ween 
  thou wilt, thy woes each one."<BR>Leaped up the graybeard: God he 
  thanked,<BR>mighty Lord, for the man's brave words.<BR>For Hrothgar soon a 
  horse was saddled<BR>wave-maned steed. The sovran wise<BR>stately rode on; his 
  shield-armed men<BR>followed in force. The footprints led<BR>along the 
  woodland, widely seen,<BR>a path o'er the plain, where she passed, and 
  trod<BR>the murky moor; of men-at-arms<BR>she bore the bravest and best one, 
  dead,<BR>him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On then went the atheling-born<BR>o'er stone-cliffs 
  steep and strait defiles,<BR>narrow passes and unknown ways,<BR>headlands 
  sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<BR>Foremost he[1] fared, a few at his 
  side<BR>of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<BR>till he found in a flash the 
  forested hill<BR>hanging over the hoary rock,<BR>a woful wood: the waves 
  below<BR>were dyed in blood. The Danish men<BR>had sorrow of soul, and for 
  Scyldings all,<BR>for many a hero, 'twas hard to bear,<BR>ill for earls, when 
  Aeschere's head<BR>they found by the flood on the foreland there.<BR>Waves 
  were welling, the warriors saw,<BR>hot with blood; but the horn sang 
  oft<BR>battle-song bold. The band sat down,<BR>and watched on the water 
  worm-like things,<BR>sea-dragons strange that sounded the deep,<BR>and nicors 
  that lay on the ledge of the ness --<BR>such as oft essay at hour of 
  morn<BR>on the road-of-sails their ruthless quest, --<BR>and sea-snakes and 
  monsters. These started away,<BR>swollen and savage that song to hear,<BR>that 
  war-horn's blast. The warden of Geats,<BR>with bolt from bow, then balked of 
  life,<BR>of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart<BR>went the keen war-shaft; 
  in water it seemed<BR>less doughty in swimming whom death had seized.<BR>Swift 
  on the billows, with boar-spears well<BR>hooked and barbed, it was hard 
  beset,<BR>done to death and dragged on the headland,<BR>wave-roamer wondrous. 
  Warriors viewed<BR>the grisly guest.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then girt him Beowulf<BR>in martial mail, nor 
  mourned for his life.<BR>His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<BR>woven by 
  hand, should the waters try;<BR>well could it ward the warrior's body<BR>that 
  battle should break on his breast in vain<BR>nor harm his heart by the hand of 
  a foe.<BR>And the helmet white that his head protected<BR>was destined to dare 
  the deeps of the flood,<BR>through wave-whirl win: 'twas wound with 
  chains,<BR>decked with gold, as in days of yore<BR>the weapon-smith worked it 
  wondrously,<BR>with swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<BR>brandished in 
  battle, could bite that helm.<BR>Nor was that the meanest of mighty 
  helps<BR>which Hrothgar's orator offered at need:<BR>"Hrunting" they named the 
  hilted sword,<BR>of old-time heirlooms easily first;<BR>iron was its edge, all 
  etched with poison,<BR>with battle-blood hardened, nor blenched it at 
  fight<BR>in hero's hand who held it ever,<BR>on paths of peril prepared to 
  go<BR>to folkstead[2] of foes. Not first time this<BR>it was destined to do a 
  daring task.<BR>For he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<BR>sturdy and 
  strong, that speech he had made,<BR>drunk with wine, now this weapon he 
  lent<BR>to a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<BR>under welter of

  <P>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>"Have mind, thou honored offspring 
  of Healfdene<BR>gold-friend of men, now I go on this quest,<BR>sovran wise, 
  what once was said:<BR>if in thy cause it came that I<BR>should lose my life, 
  thou wouldst loyal bide<BR>to me, though fallen, in father's place!<BR>Be 
  guardian, thou, to this group of my thanes,<BR>my warrior-friends, if War 
  should seize me;<BR>and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<BR>Hrothgar beloved, 
  to Hygelac send!<BR>Geatland's king may ken by the gold,<BR>Hrethel's son see,

  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these words the Weder-Geat lord<BR>boldly 
  hastened, biding never<BR>answer at all: the ocean floods<BR>closed o'er the 
  hero. Long while of the day<BR>fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.<BR>Soon 
  found the fiend who the flood-domain<BR>sword-hungry held these hundred 
  winters,<BR>greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<BR>some man, was 
  raiding her monster-realm.<BR>She grasped out for him with grisly 
  claws,<BR>and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<BR>his body hale; the 
  breastplate hindered,<BR>as she strove to shatter the sark of war,<BR>the 
  linked harness, with loathsome hand.<BR>Then bore this brine-wolf, when bottom 
  she touched,<BR>the lord of rings to the lair she haunted<BR>whiles vainly he 
  strove, though his valor held,<BR>weapon to wield against wondrous 
  monsters<BR>that sore beset him; sea-beasts many<BR>tried with fierce tusks to 
  tear his mail,<BR>and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<BR>he was 
  now in some hall, he knew not which,<BR>where water never could work him 
  harm,<BR>nor through the roof could reach him ever<BR>fangs of the flood. 
  Firelight he saw,<BR>beams of a blaze that brightly shone.<BR>Then the warrior 
  was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<BR>mere-wife monstrous. For mighty 
  stroke<BR>he swung his blade, and the blow withheld not.<BR>Then sang on her 
  head that seemly blade<BR>its war-song wild. But the warrior found<BR>the 
  light-of-battle[1] was loath to bite,<BR>to harm the heart: its hard edge 
  failed<BR>the noble at need, yet had known of old<BR>strife hand to hand, and 
  had helmets cloven,<BR>doomed men's fighting-gear. First time, this,<BR>for 
  the gleaming blade that its glory fell.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm still stood, nor failed in valor,<BR>heedful

  <P>'MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<BR>old-sword of Eotens, 
  with edge of proof,<BR>warriors' heirloom, weapon unmatched,<BR>-- save only 
  'twas more than other men<BR>to bandy-of-battle could bear at all --<BR>as the 
  giants had wrought it, ready and keen.<BR>Seized then its chain-hilt the 
  Scyldings' chieftain,<BR>bold and battle-grim, brandished the 
  sword,<BR>reckless of life, and so wrathfully smote<BR>that it gripped her 
  neck and grasped her hard,<BR>her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced 
  through<BR>that fated-one's flesh: to floor she sank.<BR>Bloody the blade: he 
  was blithe of his deed.<BR>Then blazed forth light. 'Twas bright within<BR>as 
  when from the sky there shines unclouded<BR>heaven's candle. The hall he 
  scanned.<BR>By the wall then went he; his weapon raised<BR>high by its hilts 
  the Hygelac-thane,<BR>angry and eager. That edge was not useless<BR>to the 
  warrior now. He wished with speed<BR>Grendel to guerdon for grim raids 
  many,<BR>for the war he waged on Western-Danes<BR>oftener far than an only 
  time,<BR>when of Hrothgar's hearth-companions<BR>he slew in slumber, in sleep 
  devoured,<BR>fifteen men of the folk of Danes,<BR>and as many others outward 
  bore,<BR>his horrible prey. Well paid for that<BR>the wrathful prince! For now 
  prone he saw<BR>Grendel stretched there, spent with war,<BR>spoiled of life, 
  so scathed had left him<BR>Heorot's battle. The body sprang far<BR>when after 
  death it endured the blow,<BR>sword-stroke savage, that severed its 
  head.<BR>Soon,[1] then, saw the sage companions<BR>who waited with Hrothgar, 
  watching the flood,<BR>that the tossing waters turbid grew,<BR>blood-stained 
  the mere. Old men together,<BR>hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<BR>the warrior 
  would not, they weened, again,<BR>proud of conquest, come to seek<BR>their 
  mighty master. To many it seemed<BR>the wolf-of-the-waves had won his 
  life.<BR>The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<BR>left the headland; 
  homeward went<BR>the gold-friend of men.[2] But the guests sat on,<BR>stared 
  at the surges, sick in heart,<BR>and wished, yet weened not, their winsome 
  lord<BR>again to see.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that sword began,<BR>from blood of the fight, 
  in battle-droppings,[3]<BR>war-blade, to wane: 'twas a wondrous thing<BR>that 
  all of it melted as ice is wont<BR>when frosty fetters the Father 
  loosens,<BR>unwinds the wave-bonds, wielding all<BR>seasons and times: the 
  true God he!</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the 
  Geats<BR>precious things, though a plenty he saw,<BR>save only the head and 
  that hilt withal<BR>blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<BR>burned was 
  the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<BR>so poisoned the hell-sprite who 
  perished within there.<BR>Soon he was swimming who safe saw in 
  combat<BR>downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<BR>The clashing 
  waters were cleansed now,<BR>waste of waves, where the wandering fiend<BR>her 
  life-days left and this lapsing world.<BR>Swam then to strand the 
  sailors'-refuge,<BR>sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty glad,<BR>of burden brave he

  thane-band choice of their chieftain blithe,<BR>that safe and sound they could 
  see him again.<BR>Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor<BR>deftly they 
  doffed: now drowsed the mere,<BR>water 'neath welkin, with war-blood 
  stained.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth they fared by the footpaths thence,<BR>merry 
  at heart the highways measured,<BR>well-known roads. Courageous men<BR>carried 
  the head from the cliff by the sea,<BR>an arduous task for all the

  thou seest it here.<BR>Not lightly did I with my life escape!<BR>In war under 
  water this work I essayed<BR>with endless effort; and even so<BR>my strength 
  had been lost had the Lord not shielded&nbsp;me.<BR>Not a whit could I with 
  Hrunting do<BR>in work of war, though the weapon is good;<BR>yet a sword the 
  Sovran of Men vouchsafed me<BR>to spy on the wall there, in splendor 
  hanging,<BR>old, gigantic, -- how oft He guides<BR>the friendless wight! -- 
  and I fought with that brand,<BR>felling in fight, since fate was with 
  me,<BR>the house's wardens. That war-sword then<BR>all burned, bright blade, 
  when the blood gushed o'er it,<BR>battle-sweat hot; but the hilt I brought 
  back<BR>from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds<BR>death-fall of 
  Danes, as was due and right.<BR>And this is my hest, that in Heorot 
  now<BR>safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,<BR>and every thane of all 
  thy folk<BR>both old and young; no evil fear,<BR>Scyldings' lord, from that 
  side again,<BR>aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou must!"<BR>Then the golden 
  hilt, for that gray-haired leader,<BR>hoary hero, in hand was 
  laid,<BR>giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed it<BR>after downfall of 
  devils, the Danish lord,<BR>wonder-smiths' work, since the world was rid<BR>of 
  that grim-souled fiend, the foe of God,<BR>murder-marked, and his mother as 
  well.<BR>Now it passed into power of the people's king,<BR>best of all that 
  the oceans bound<BR>who have scattered their gold o'er Scandia's 
  isle.<BR>Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,<BR>heirloom old, where was 
  etched the rise<BR>of that far-off fight when the floods 
  o'erwhelmed,<BR>raging waves, the race of giants<BR>(fearful their fate!), a 
  folk estranged<BR>from God Eternal: whence guerdon due<BR>in that waste of 
  waters the Wielder paid them.<BR>So on the guard of shining gold<BR>in runic 
  staves it was rightly said<BR>for whom the serpent-traced sword was 
  wrought,<BR>best of blades, in bygone days,<BR>and the hilt well wound. -- The 
  wise-one spake,<BR>son of Healfdene; silent were all:--</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, so may he say who sooth and right<BR>follows 
  'mid folk, of far times mindful,<BR>a land-warden old,[1] that this earl

  not Heremod thus<BR>to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,<BR>nor grew for 
  their grace, but for grisly slaughter,<BR>for doom of death to the 
  Danishmen.<BR>He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,<BR>companions at

  him the Maker with might endowed,<BR>delights of power, and uplifted 
  high<BR>above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,<BR>his breast-hoard, grew, 
  no bracelets gave he<BR>to Danes as was due; he endured all joyless<BR>strain 
  of struggle and stress of woe,<BR>long feud with his folk. Here find thy 
  lesson!<BR>Of virtue advise thee! This verse I have said&nbsp;for 
  thee,<BR>wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems<BR>how to sons of men 
  Almighty God<BR>in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom,<BR>estate, high

  heart of the hero of high-born race, --<BR>in seat ancestral assigns him 
  bliss,<BR>his folk's sure fortress in fee to hold,<BR>puts in his power great 
  parts of the earth,<BR>empire so ample, that end of it<BR>this 
  wanter-of-wisdom weeneth none.<BR>So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm 
  him<BR>illness or age; no evil cares<BR>shadow his spirit; no sword-hate 
  threatens<BR>from ever an enemy: all the world<BR>wends at his will, no worse 
  he knoweth,<BR>till all within him obstinate pride<BR>waxes and wakes while

  well.<BR>If ever on earth I am able to win me<BR>more of thy love, O lord of

  still!<BR>If it come to me ever across the seas<BR>that neighbor foemen annoy

  sovran's son, he will surely there<BR>find his friends. A far-off land<BR>each 
  man should visit who vaunts him brave."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:--<BR>"These 
  words of thine the wisest God<BR>sent to thy soul! No sager counsel<BR>from so

  art wary,<BR>art wise in words! I ween indeed<BR>if ever it hap that Hrethel's

  elder and lord,<BR>people's leader, -- and life be thine, --<BR>no seemlier 
  man will the Sea-Geats find<BR>at all to choose for their chief and 
  king,<BR>for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt<BR>thy kinsman's 
  kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me<BR>the longer the better, Beowulf 
  loved!<BR>Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,<BR>sons of the 
  Geat and Spear-Dane folk,<BR>shall have mutual peace, and from murderous 
  strife,<BR>such as once they waged, from war refrain.<BR>Long as I rule this 
  realm so wide,<BR>let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold<BR>each other 
  greet o'er the gannet's-bath,<BR>and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling 
  waves<BR>tokens of love. I trow my landfolk<BR>towards friend and foe are 
  firmly joined,<BR>and honor they keep in the olden way."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son<BR>gave 
  treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls<BR>bade him fare with the gifts to 
  his folk beloved,<BR>hale to his home, and in haste return.<BR>Then kissed the 
  king of kin renowned,<BR>Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,<BR>and 
  fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears<BR>of the hoary-headed. Heavy with 
  winters,<BR>he had chances twain, but he clung to this,[1] --<BR>that each 
  should look on the other again,<BR>and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear 
  to him.<BR>his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;<BR>safe in his soul a 
  secret longing,<BR>locked in his mind, for that loved man<BR>burned in his

  ship<BR>with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows<BR>that trusty timber should

  <P>HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,<BR>sandy strand of the sea to 
  tread<BR>and widespread ways. The world's great candle,<BR>sun shone from 
  south. They strode along<BR>with sturdy steps to the spot they knew<BR>where 
  the battle-king young, his burg within,<BR>slayer of Ongentheow, shared the 
  rings,<BR>shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac<BR>Beowulf's coming was quickly told, 
  --<BR>that there in the court the clansmen's refuge,<BR>the shield-companion 
  sound and alive,<BR>hale from the hero-play homeward strode.<BR>With haste in 
  the hall, by highest order,<BR>room for the rovers was readily made.<BR>By his 
  sovran he sat, come safe from battle,<BR>kinsman by kinsman. His kindly 
  lord<BR>he first had greeted in gracious form,<BR>with manly words. The mead 
  dispensing,<BR>came through the high hall Haereth's daughter,<BR>winsome to 
  warriors, wine-cup bore<BR>to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then<BR>his 
  comrade fairly with question plied<BR>in the lofty hall, sore longing to 
  know<BR>what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.<BR>"What came of thy quest, 
  my kinsman Beowulf,<BR>when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder<BR>battle 
  to seek o'er the briny sea,<BR>combat in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou<BR>aid 
  at all, the honored chief,<BR>in his wide-known woes? With waves of care<BR>my 
  sad heart seethed; I sore mistrusted<BR>my loved one's venture: long I begged 
  thee<BR>by no means to seek that slaughtering monster,<BR>but suffer the 
  South-Danes to settle their feud<BR>themselves with Grendel. Now God be 
  thanked<BR>that safe and sound I can see thee now!"</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>"'Tis 
  known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,<BR>to many men, that meeting of 
  ours,<BR>struggle grim between Grendel and me,<BR>which we fought on the field 
  where full too many<BR>sorrows he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,<BR>evils 
  unending. These all I avenged.<BR>No boast can be from breed of 
  Grendel,<BR>any on earth, for that uproar at dawn,<BR>from the longest-lived 
  of the loathsome race<BR>in fleshly fold! -- But first I went<BR>Hrothgar to 
  greet in the hall of gifts,<BR>where Healfdene's kinsman 
  high-renowned,<BR>soon as my purpose was plain to him,<BR>assigned me a seat 
  by his son and heir.<BR>The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never<BR>such 
  merry men over mead in hall<BR>have I heard under heaven! The high-born 
  queen,<BR>people's peace-bringer, passed through the hall,<BR>cheered the 
  young clansmen, clasps of gold,<BR>ere she sought her seat, to sundry 
  gave.<BR>Oft to the heroes Hrothgar's daughter,<BR>to earls in turn, the 
  ale-cup tendered, --<BR>she whom I heard these hall-companions<BR>Freawaru 
  name, when fretted gold<BR>she proffered the warriors. Promised is 
  she,<BR>gold-decked maid, to the glad son of Froda.<BR>Sage this seems to the 
  Scylding's-friend,<BR>kingdom's-keeper: he counts it wise<BR>the woman to wed 
  so and ward off feud,<BR>store of slaughter. But seldom ever<BR>when men are 
  slain, does the murder-spear sink<BR>but briefest while, though the bride be 
  fair![1]</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord,<BR>and 
  as little each of his liegemen all,<BR>when a thane of the Danes, in that 
  doughty throng,<BR>goes with the lady along their hall,<BR>and on him the 
  old-time heirlooms glisten<BR>hard and ring-decked, Heathobard's 
  treasure,<BR>weapons that once they wielded fair<BR>until they lost at the 
  linden-play[2]<BR>liegeman leal and their lives as well.<BR>Then, over the 
  ale, on this heirloom gazing,<BR>some ash-wielder old who has all in 
  mind<BR>that spear-death of men,[3] -- he is stern of mood,<BR>heavy at heart, 
  -- in the hero young<BR>tests the temper and tries the soul<BR>and war-hate 
  wakens, with words like these:--<BR>_Canst thou not, comrade, ken that 
  sword<BR>which to the fray thy father carried<BR>in his final feud, 'neath the 
  fighting-mask,<BR>dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him<BR>and wielded 
  the war-place on Withergild's fall,<BR>after havoc of heroes, those hardy 
  Scyldings?<BR>Now, the son of a certain slaughtering Dane,<BR>proud of his 
  treasure, paces this hall,<BR>joys in the killing, and carries the 
  jewel[4]<BR>that rightfully ought to be owned by thee!_<BR>Thus he urges and 
  eggs him all the time<BR>with keenest words, till occasion offers<BR>that 
  Freawaru's thane, for his father's deed,<BR>after bite of brand in his blood 
  must slumber,<BR>losing his life; but that liegeman flies<BR>living away, for 
  the land he kens.<BR>And thus be broken on both their sides<BR>oaths of the 
  earls, when Ingeld's breast<BR>wells with war-hate, and wife-love now<BR>after 
  the care-billows cooler grows.<BR>"So[5] I hold not high the Heathobards' 
  faith<BR>due to the Danes, or their during love<BR>and pact of peace. -- But I 
  pass from that,<BR>turning to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,<BR>and saying in 
  full how the fight resulted,<BR>hand-fray of heroes. When heaven's

  mighty kinsman,<BR>and all of the brave man's body devoured.<BR>Yet none the 
  earlier, empty-handed,<BR>would the bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of 
  bale,<BR>outward go from the gold-decked hall:<BR>but me he attacked in his 
  terror of might,<BR>with greedy hand grasped me. A glove hung by 
  him[6]<BR>wide and wondrous, wound with bands;<BR>and in artful wise it all 
  was wrought,<BR>by devilish craft, of dragon-skins.<BR>Me therein, an innocent 
  man,<BR>the fiendish foe was fain to thrust<BR>with many another. He might not 
  so,<BR>when I all angrily upright stood.<BR>'Twere long to relate how that 
  land-destroyer<BR>I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;<BR>yet there, my prince, 
  this people of thine<BR>got fame by my fighting. He fled away,<BR>and a little 
  space his life preserved;<BR>but there staid behind him his stronger 
  hand<BR>left in Heorot; heartsick thence<BR>on the floor of the ocean that 
  outcast fell.<BR>Me for this struggle the Scyldings'-friend<BR>paid in plenty 
  with plates of gold,<BR>with many a treasure, when morn had come<BR>and we all 
  at the banquet-board sat down.<BR>Then was song and glee. The gray-haired 
  Scylding,<BR>much tested, told of the times of yore.<BR>Whiles the hero his

  sadness, or said aright<BR>legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;<BR>or for 
  years of his youth he would yearn at times,<BR>for strength of old struggles, 
  now stricken with age,<BR>hoary hero: his heart surged full<BR>when, wise with 
  winters, he wailed their flight.<BR>Thus in the hall the whole of that 
  day<BR>at ease we feasted, till fell o'er earth<BR>another night. Anon full 
  ready<BR>in greed of vengeance, Grendel's mother<BR>set forth all doleful. 
  Dead was her son<BR>through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous<BR>with 
  fury fell a foeman she slew,<BR>avenged her offspring. From Aeschere 
  old,<BR>loyal councillor, life was gone;<BR>nor might they e'en, when morning 
  broke,<BR>those Danish people, their death-done comrade<BR>burn with brands, 
  on balefire lay<BR>the man they mourned. Under mountain stream<BR>she had 
  carried the corpse with cruel hands.<BR>For Hrothgar that was the heaviest 
  sorrow<BR>of all that had laden the lord of his folk.<BR>The leader then, by 
  thy life, besought me<BR>(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves' coil<BR>to play 
  the hero and hazard my being<BR>for glory of prowess: my guerdon he 
  pledged.<BR>I then in the waters -- 'tis widely known --<BR>that 
  sea-floor-guardian savage found.<BR>Hand-to-hand there a while we 
  struggled;<BR>billows welled blood; in the briny hall<BR>her head I hewed with 
  a hardy blade<BR>from Grendel's mother, -- and gained my life,<BR>though not 
  without danger. My doom was not yet.<BR>Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene's 
  son,<BR>gave me in guerdon great gifts of price. </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><EM><SMALL>[1] Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his 
    journey, but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain policies at 
    the Danish court. Talk of interpolation here is absurd. As both Beowulf and 
    Hygelac know, -- and the folk for whom the Beowulf was put together also 
    knew, -- Froda was king of the Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once 
    near neighbors of Angle and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen 
    in fight with the Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his 
    daughter as "peace-weaver" and wife to the young king Ingeld, son of the 
    slain Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his observation of 
    the particular case, foretells trouble.<BR>[2] Play of shields, battle. A 
    Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight, and takes his sword and armor, 
    leaving them to a son. This son is selected to accompany his mistress, the 
    young princess Freawaru, to her new home&nbsp; when she is Ingeld's queen. 
    Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda in hall. An old warrior points it out 
    to Ingeld, and eggs him on to vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is 
    killed; but the murderer, afraid of results, and knowing the land, escapes. 
    So the old feud must break out again.<BR>[3] That is, their disastrous 
    battle and the slaying of their king.<BR>[4] The sword. <BR>[5] Beowulf 
    returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat as follows, he says; 
    sketches a little tragic story; and with this prophecy by illustration 
    returns to the tale of his adventure.<BR>[6] Not an actual glove, but a sort 
    of bag.</SMALL></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So held this king to the customs old,<BR>that I

  proffer them all,<BR>gladly give them. Thy grace alone<BR>can find me favor. 
  Few indeed<BR>have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!"<BR>Then he bade them 
  bear him the boar-head standard,<BR>the battle-helm high, and breastplate 
  gray,<BR>the splendid sword; then spake in form:--<BR>"Me this war-gear the

  weave one another the net of wiles,<BR>or with deep-hid treachery death 
  contrive<BR>for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever<BR>by hardy Hygelac

  the necklace to Hygd he presented,<BR>wonder-wrought treasure, which 
  Wealhtheow gave&nbsp;him<BR>sovran's daughter: three steeds he

  the breast of the queen.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow<BR>as a 
  man remarked for mighty deeds<BR>and acts of honor. At ale he slew 
  not<BR>comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,<BR>though of sons of earth his 
  strength was greatest,<BR>a glorious gift that God had sent<BR>the splendid 
  leader. Long was he spurned,<BR>and worthless by Geatish warriors held;<BR>him 
  at mead the master-of-clans<BR>failed full oft to favor at all.<BR>Slack and

  came,<BR>to the warrior honored, for all his woes. --</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bulwark-of-earls[1] bade bring 
  within,<BR>hardy chieftain, Hrethel's heirloom<BR>garnished with gold: no Geat 
  e'er knew<BR>in shape of a sword a statelier prize.<BR>The brand he laid in 
  Beowulf's lap;<BR>and of hides assigned him seven thousand,[2]<BR>with house 
  and high-seat. They held in common<BR>land alike by their line of

  the realm itself. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now further it fell with the flight of

  at the van of his victor-folk<BR>sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,<BR>in 
  arms o'erwhelming Hereric's nephew.<BR>Then Beowulf came as king this 
  broad<BR>realm to wield; and he ruled it well<BR>fifty winters,[4] a wise old 
  prince,<BR>warding his land, until One began<BR>in the dark of night, a 
  Dragon, to rage.<BR>In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,<BR>in the

    <P><EM><SMALL>[1] Hygelac.<BR>[2] This is generally assumed to mean hides,

    general drift of the meaning can be rescued. For one thing, we have the old 
    myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure. But with this runs the story of 
    some noble, last of his race, who hides all his wealth within this barrow 
    and there chants his farewell to life's glories. After his death the dragon 
    takes possession of the hoard and watches over it. A condemned or banished 
    man, desperate, hides in the barrow, discovers the treasure, and while the

  found,<BR>who, blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,<BR>naked foe-dragon 
  flying by night<BR>folded in fire: the folk of earth<BR>dread him sore. 'Tis 
  his doom to seek<BR>hoard in the graves, and heathen gold<BR>to watch, 
  many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful this plague-of-the-people thus<BR>held the 
  house of the hoard in earth<BR>three hundred winters; till One 
  aroused<BR>wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing<BR>that costly cup, and 
  the king implored<BR>for bond of peace. So the barrow was plundered,<BR>borne 
  off was booty. His boon was granted<BR>that wretched man; and his ruler 
  saw<BR>first time what was fashioned in far-off days.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.<BR>O'er 
  the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found<BR>footprint of foe who so far had 
  gone<BR>in his hidden craft by the creature's head. --<BR>So may the undoomed 
  easily flee<BR>evils and exile, if only he gain<BR>the grace of The Wielder! 
  -- That warden of gold<BR>o'er the ground went seeking, greedy to find<BR>the 
  man who wrought him such wrong in sleep.<BR>Savage and burning, the barrow he 
  circled<BR>all without; nor was any there,<BR>none in the waste.... Yet war he 
  desired,<BR>was eager for battle. The barrow he entered,<BR>sought the cup, 
  and discovered soon<BR>that some one of mortals had searched his 
  treasure,<BR>his lordly gold. The guardian waited<BR>ill-enduring till evening 
  came;<BR>boiling with wrath was the barrow's keeper,<BR>and fain with flame 
  the foe to pay<BR>for the dear cup's loss. -- Now day was fled<BR>as the worm 
  had wished. By its wall no more<BR>was it glad to bide, but burning 
  flew<BR>folded in flame: a fearful beginning<BR>for sons of the soil; and soon 
  it came,<BR>in the doom of their lord, to a dreadful end.</P>
  <P>XXXIII </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,<BR>and 
  bright homes burned. The blaze stood high<BR>all landsfolk frighting. No 
  living thing<BR>would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.<BR>Wide was the 
  dragon's warring seen,<BR>its fiendish fury far and near,<BR>as the grim 
  destroyer those Geatish people<BR>hated and hounded. To hidden lair,<BR>to its 
  hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.<BR>Folk of the land it had lapped in 
  flame,<BR>with bale and brand. In its barrow it trusted,<BR>its battling and 
  bulwarks: that boast was vain! </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Beowulf then the bale was told<BR>quickly and 
  truly: the king's own home,<BR>of buildings the best, in brand-waves 
  melted,<BR>that gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man<BR>sad in heart, 
  'twas heaviest sorrow.<BR>The sage assumed that his sovran God<BR>he had 
  angered, breaking ancient law,<BR>and embittered the Lord. His breast 
  within<BR>with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.<BR>The folk's own 
  fastness that fiery dragon<BR>with flame had destroyed, and the stronghold 
  all<BR>washed by waves; but the warlike king,<BR>prince of the Weders, plotted 
  vengeance.<BR>Warriors'-bulwark, he bade them work<BR>all of iron -- the 
  earl's commander --<BR>a war-shield wondrous: well he knew<BR>that forest-wood 
  against fire were worthless,<BR>linden could aid not. -- Atheling brave,<BR>he 
  was fated to finish this fleeting life,[1]<BR>his days on earth, and the 
  dragon with him,<BR>though long it had watched o'er the wealth of 
  the&nbsp;hoard! --<BR>Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,<BR>to follow the 
  flyer-afar with a host,<BR>a broad-flung band; nor the battle feared 
  he,<BR>nor deemed he dreadful the dragon's warring,<BR>its vigor and valor: 
  ventures desperate<BR>he had passed a-plenty, and perils of 
  war,<BR>contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,<BR>Hrothgar's hall he had 
  wholly purged,<BR>and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,<BR>loathsome 
  breed! Not least was that<BR>of hand-to-hand fights where Hygelac 
  fell,<BR>when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,<BR>lord of his folk, in 
  the Frisian land,<BR>son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts died,<BR>by brands 
  down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled<BR>through strength of himself and his 
  swimming power,<BR>though alone, and his arms were laden with thirty<BR>coats 
  of mail, when he came to the sea!<BR>Nor yet might Hetwaras[2] haughtily 
  boast<BR>their craft of contest, who carried against him<BR>shields to the 
  fight: but few escaped<BR>from strife with the hero to seek their 
  homes!<BR>Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow's son<BR>lonely and sorrowful, seeking 
  his land,<BR>where Hygd made him offer of hoard and realm,<BR>rings and 
  royal-seat, reckoning naught<BR>the strength of her son to save their 
  kingdom<BR>from hostile hordes, after Hygelac's death.<BR>No sooner for this 
  could the stricken ones<BR>in any wise move that atheling's mind<BR>over young 
  Heardred's head as lord<BR>and ruler of all the realm to be:<BR>yet the hero 
  upheld him with helpful words,<BR>aided in honor, till, older grown,<BR>he 
  wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles<BR>sought him o'er seas, the sons 
  of Ohtere,<BR>who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings'-helmet,<BR>the 
  bravest and best that broke the rings,<BR>in Swedish land, of the sea-kings' 
  line,<BR>haughty hero.[3] Hence Heardred's end.<BR>For shelter he gave them, 
  sword-death came,<BR>the blade's fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;<BR>but the 
  son of Ongentheow sought again<BR>house and home when Heardred 
  fell,<BR>leaving Beowulf lord of Geats<BR>and gift-seat's master. -- A good

  and my hand, for the hoard shall strive."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made<BR>his last of 
  all: "I have lived through many<BR>wars in my youth; now once again,<BR>old 
  folk-defender, feud will I seek,<BR>do doughty deeds, if the dark 
  destroyer<BR>forth from his cavern come to fight me!"<BR>Then hailed he the

  dear,<BR>comrades of war: "I should carry no weapon,<BR>no sword to the 
  serpent, if sure I knew<BR>how, with such enemy, else my vows<BR>I could gain 
  as I did in Grendel's day.<BR>But fire in this fight I must fear me 
  now,<BR>and poisonous breath; so I bring with me<BR>breastplate and board.[3] 
  From the barrow's keeper<BR>no footbreadth flee I. One fight shall end<BR>our 
  war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,<BR>all mankind's master. My mood is

  stone; and within, a stream<BR>that broke from the barrow. The brooklet's 
  wave<BR>was hot with fire. The hoard that way<BR>he never could hope unharmed

  his breast, for he burst with rage,<BR>the Weder-Geat prince a word 
  outgo;<BR>stormed the stark-heart; stern went ringing<BR>and clear his cry 
  'neath the cliff-rocks gray.<BR>The hoard-guard heard a human voice;<BR>his 
  rage was enkindled. No respite now<BR>for pact of peace! The 
  poison-breath<BR>of that foul worm first came forth from the cave,<BR>hot 
  reek-of-fight: the rocks resounded.<BR>Stout by the stone-way his shield he 
  raised,<BR>lord of the Geats, against the loathed-one;<BR>while with courage 
  keen that coiled foe<BR>came seeking strife. The sturdy king<BR>had drawn his 
  sword, not dull of edge,<BR>heirloom old; and each of the two<BR>felt fear of 
  his foe, though fierce their mood.<BR>Stoutly stood with his shield 
  high-raised<BR>the warrior king, as the worm now coiled<BR>together amain: the

  atheling's heirloom. Its edge was turned<BR>brown blade, on the bone, and bit 
  more feebly<BR>than its noble master had need of then<BR>in his baleful 
  stress. -- Then the barrow's keeper<BR>waxed full wild for that weighty 
  blow,<BR>cast deadly flames; wide drove and far<BR>those vicious fires. No 
  victor's glory<BR>the Geats' lord boasted; his brand had failed,<BR>naked in

  men, leaving<BR>this lapsing life! -- Not long it was<BR>ere those champions

  the folk-commander!<BR>Nor yet about him his band of comrades,<BR>sons of

  requital,<BR>for hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring<BR>stress of this 
  sort! Himself who chose us<BR>from all his army to aid him now,<BR>urged us to

  spear<BR>and hardy 'neath helm, though this hero-work<BR>our leader hoped 
  unhelped and alone<BR>to finish for us, -- folk-defender<BR>who hath got him 
  glory greater than all men<BR>for daring deeds! Now the day is come<BR>that 
  our noble master has need of the might<BR>of warriors stout. Let us stride 
  along<BR>the hero to help while the heat is about him<BR>glowing and grim! For 
  God is my witness<BR>I am far more fain the fire should seize<BR>along with my 
  lord these limbs of mine![3]<BR>Unsuiting it seems our shields to 
  bear<BR>homeward hence, save here we essay<BR>to fell the foe and defend the 
  life<BR>of the Weders' lord. I wot 'twere shame<BR>on the law of our land if 
  alone the king<BR>out of Geatish warriors woe endured<BR>and sank in the 
  struggle! My sword and helmet,<BR>breastplate and board, for us both shall 
  serve!"<BR>Through slaughter-reek strode he to succor 
  his&nbsp;chieftain,<BR>his battle-helm bore, and brief words 
  spake:--<BR>"Beowulf dearest, do all bravely,<BR>as in youthful days of yore 
  thou vowedst<BR>that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise<BR>thy 
  glory droop! Now, great in deeds,<BR>atheling steadfast, with all thy 
  strength<BR>shield thy life! I will stand to help thee."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the words the worm came once again,<BR>murderous 
  monster mad with rage,<BR>with fire-billows flaming, its foes to seek,<BR>the 
  hated men. In heat-waves burned<BR>that board[4] to the boss, and the 
  breastplate failed<BR>to shelter at all the spear-thane young.<BR>Yet quickly 
  under his kinsman's shield<BR>went eager the earl, since his own was 
  now<BR>all burned by the blaze. The bold king again<BR>had mind of his glory: 
  with might his glaive<BR>was driven into the dragon's head, --<BR>blow nerved 
  by hate. But Naegling[5] was shivered,<BR>broken in battle was Beowulf's 
  sword,<BR>old and gray. 'Twas granted him not<BR>that ever the edge of iron at 
  all<BR>could help him at strife: too strong was his hand,<BR>so the tale is 
  told, and he tried too far<BR>with strength of stroke all swords he 
  wielded,<BR>though sturdy their steel: they steaded him nought.<BR>Then for 
  the third time thought on its feud<BR>that folk-destroyer, fire-dread 
  dragon,<BR>and rushed on the hero, where room allowed,<BR>battle-grim, 
  burning; its bitter teeth<BR>closed on his neck, and covered him<BR>with waves

  <P>XXXVIII </P>
  <P>I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan<BR>at wish and word of his 
  wounded king, --<BR>war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,<BR>battle-sark, bore 
  'neath the barrow's roof.<BR>Then the clansman keen, of conquest 
  proud,<BR>passing the seat,[1] saw store of jewels<BR>and glistening gold the 
  ground along;<BR>by the wall were marvels, and many a vessel<BR>in the den of 
  the dragon, the dawn-flier old:<BR>unburnished bowls of bygone men<BR>reft of 
  richness; rusty helms<BR>of the olden age; and arm-rings many<BR>wondrously 
  woven. -- Such wealth of gold,<BR>booty from barrow, can burden with 
  pride<BR>each human wight: let him hide it who will! --<BR>His glance too fell 
  on a gold-wove banner<BR>high o'er the hoard, of handiwork 
  noblest,<BR>brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,<BR>all the earth-floor 
  he easily saw<BR>and viewed all these vessels. No vestige now<BR>was seen of 
  the serpent: the sword had ta'en him.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I heard, the hill of its hoard was 
  reft,<BR>old work of giants, by one alone;<BR>he burdened his bosom with 
  beakers and plate<BR>at his own good will, and the ensign took,<BR>brightest 
  of beacons. -- The blade of his lord<BR>-- its edge was iron -- had injured 
  deep<BR>one that guarded the golden hoard<BR>many a year and its 
  murder-fire<BR>spread hot round the barrow in horror-billows<BR>at midnight 
  hour, till it met its doom.<BR>Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred 
  him<BR>his track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,<BR>high-souled hero, if 
  haply he'd find<BR>alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,<BR>weakening 
  fast by the wall of the cave.<BR>So he carried the load. His lord and 
  king<BR>he found all bleeding, famous chief<BR>at the lapse of life. The 
  liegeman again<BR>plashed him with water, till point of word<BR>broke through 
  the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,<BR>sage and sad, as he stared at the gold. 
  --<BR>"For the gold and treasure, to God my thanks,<BR>to the 
  Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,<BR>for what I behold, to Heaven's 
  Lord,<BR>for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk<BR>or ever the day of 
  my death be run!<BR>Now I've bartered here for booty of treasure<BR>the last 
  of my life, so look ye well<BR>to the needs of my land! No longer I 
  tarry.<BR>A barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise<BR>for my ashes. 'Twill 
  shine by the shore of the flood,<BR>to folk of mine memorial fair<BR>on Hrones 
  Headland high uplifted,<BR>that ocean-wanderers oft may hail<BR>Beowulf's 
  Barrow, as back from far<BR>they drive their keels o'er the darkling 
wave."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his neck he unclasped the collar of 
  gold,<BR>valorous king, to his vassal gave it<BR>with bright-gold helmet, 
  breastplate, and ring,<BR>to the youthful thane: bade him use them in joy.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art end and remnant of all our race<BR>the 
  Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,<BR>all my line, to the land of 
  doom,<BR>earls in their glory: I after them go."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This word was the last which the wise old 
  man<BR>harbored in heart ere hot death-waves<BR>of balefire he chose. From his 
  bosom fled<BR>his soul to seek the saints' reward. </P>

  <P>IT was heavy hap for that hero young<BR>on his lord beloved to look and 
  find him<BR>lying on earth with life at end,<BR>sorrowful sight. But the 
  slayer too,<BR>awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,<BR>lay felled in fight, 
  nor, fain of its treasure,<BR>could the writhing monster rule it more.<BR>For 
  edges of iron had ended its days,<BR>hard and battle-sharp, hammers' 
  leaving;[1]<BR>and that flier-afar had fallen to ground<BR>hushed by its hurt, 
  its hoard all near,<BR>no longer lusty aloft to whirl<BR>at midnight, making 
  its merriment seen,<BR>proud of its prizes: prone it sank<BR>by the handiwork 
  of the hero-king.<BR>Forsooth among folk but few achieve,<BR>-- though sturdy 
  and strong, as stories tell me,<BR>and never so daring in deed of valor, 
  --<BR>the perilous breath of a poison-foe<BR>to brave, and to rush on the 
  ring-board hall,<BR>whenever his watch the warden keeps<BR>bold in the barrow. 
  Beowulf paid<BR>the price of death for that precious hoard;<BR>and each of the 
  foes had found the end<BR>of this fleeting life.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Befell erelong<BR>that the laggards in war the wood 
  had left,<BR>trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,<BR>fearing before to 
  flourish a spear<BR>in the sore distress of their sovran lord.<BR>Now in their 
  shame their shields they carried,<BR>armor of fight, where the old man 
  lay;<BR>and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied he sat<BR>at his sovran's shoulder, 
  shieldsman good,<BR>to wake him with water.[2] Nowise it availed.<BR>Though 
  well he wished it, in world no more<BR>could he barrier life for that 
  leader-of-battles<BR>nor baffle the will of all-wielding God.<BR>Doom of the 
  Lord was law o'er the deeds<BR>of every man, as it is to-day.<BR>Grim was the 
  answer, easy to get,<BR>from the youth for those that had yielded to 
  fear!<BR>Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan, --<BR>mournful he looked on those 
  men unloved:--<BR>"Who sooth will speak, can say indeed<BR>that the ruler who 
  gave you golden rings<BR>and the harness of war in which ye stand<BR>-- for he 
  at ale-bench often-times<BR>bestowed on hall-folk helm and 
  breastplate,<BR>lord to liegemen, the likeliest gear<BR>which near of far he 
  could find to give, --<BR>threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,<BR>on 
  men who failed when the foemen came!<BR>Not at all could the king of his 
  comrades-in-arms<BR>venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,<BR>God, gave 
  him grace that he got revenge<BR>sole with his sword in stress and need.<BR>To 
  rescue his life, 'twas little that I<BR>could serve him in struggle; yet shift 
  I made<BR>(hopeless it seemed) to help my kinsman.<BR>Its strength ever waned, 
  when with weapon I struck<BR>that fatal foe, and the fire less 
  strongly<BR>flowed from its head. -- Too few the heroes<BR>in throe of contest 
  that thronged to our king!<BR>Now gift of treasure and girding of 
  sword,<BR>joy of the house and home-delight<BR>shall fail your folk; his 
  freehold-land<BR>every clansman within your kin<BR>shall lose and leave, when 
  lords highborn<BR>hear afar of that flight of yours,<BR>a fameless deed. Yea, 
  death is better<BR>for liegemen all than a life of shame!" </P>

  <P>THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,<BR>at the fort on the cliff, 
  where, full of sorrow,<BR>all the morning earls had sat,<BR>daring shieldsmen, 
  in doubt of twain:<BR>would they wail as dead, or welcome home,<BR>their lord 
  beloved? Little[1] kept back<BR>of the tidings new, but told them all,<BR>the 
  herald that up the headland rode. --<BR>"Now the willing-giver to Weder 
  folk<BR>in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats<BR>on the slaughter-bed sleeps by 
  the serpent's deed!<BR>And beside him is stretched that slayer-of-men<BR>with 
  knife-wounds sick:[2] no sword availed<BR>on the awesome thing in any 
  wise<BR>to work a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,<BR>Weohstan's bairn, by 
  Beowulf's side,<BR>the living earl by the other dead,<BR>and heavy of heart a 
  head-watch[3] keeps<BR>o'er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look<BR>for 
  waging of war when once unhidden<BR>to Frisian and Frank the fall of the 
  king<BR>is spread afar. -- The strife began<BR>when hot on the Hugas[4] 
  Hygelac fell<BR>and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.<BR>Him there the 
  Hetwaras humbled in war,<BR>plied with such prowess their power 
  o'erwhelming<BR>that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath it<BR>and fell in fight. 
  To his friends no wise<BR>could that earl give treasure! And ever since<BR>the 
  Merowings' favor has failed us wholly.<BR>Nor aught expect I of peace and 
  faith<BR>from Swedish folk. 'Twas spread afar<BR>how Ongentheow reft at 
  Ravenswood<BR>Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,<BR>when the folk of Geats 
  for the first time sought<BR>in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.<BR>Soon

  whole night through to that hard-pressed throng:<BR>some with the morrow his 
  sword should kill,<BR>some should go to the gallows-tree<BR>for rapture of

  <P>"THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats<BR>and the storm of their strife, 
  were seen afar,<BR>how folk against folk the fight had wakened.<BR>The ancient 
  king with his atheling band<BR>sought his citadel, sorrowing 
  much:<BR>Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.<BR>He had tested Hygelac's 
  hardihood,<BR>the proud one's prowess, would prove it no longer,<BR>defied no 
  more those fighting-wanderers<BR>nor hoped from the seamen to save his 
  hoard,<BR>his bairn and his bride: so he bent him again,<BR>old, to his 
  earth-walls. Yet after him came<BR>with slaughter for Swedes the standards of 
  Hygelac<BR>o'er peaceful plains in pride advancing,<BR>till Hrethelings fought 
  in the fenced town.[1]<BR>Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,<BR>the 
  hoary-bearded, was held at bay,<BR>and the folk-king there was forced to 
  suffer<BR>Eofor's anger. In ire, at the king<BR>Wulf Wonreding with weapon 
  struck;<BR>and the chieftain's blood, for that blow, in streams<BR>flowed 
  'neath his hair. No fear felt he,<BR>stout old Scylfing, but straightway 
  repaid<BR>in better bargain that bitter stroke<BR>and faced his foe with fell 
  intent.<BR>Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred<BR>answer to render the aged 
  chief;<BR>too soon on his head the helm was cloven;<BR>blood-bedecked he bowed 
  to earth,<BR>and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,<BR>and well he waxed, 
  though the wound was sore.<BR>Then the hardy Hygelac-thane,[2]<BR>when his 
  brother fell, with broad brand smote,<BR>giants' sword crashing through 
  giants'-helm<BR>across the shield-wall: sank the king,<BR>his folk's old 
  herdsman, fatally hurt.<BR>There were many to bind the brother's wounds<BR>and 
  lift him, fast as fate allowed<BR>his people to wield the place-of-war.<BR>But 
  Eofor took from Ongentheow,<BR>earl from other, the iron-breastplate,<BR>hard 
  sword hilted, and helmet too,<BR>and the hoar-chief's harness to Hygelac 
  carried,<BR>who took the trappings, and truly promised<BR>rich fee 'mid folk, 
  -- and fulfilled it so.<BR>For that grim strife gave the Geatish 
  lord,<BR>Hrethel's offspring, when home he came,<BR>to Eofor and Wulf a wealth 
  of treasure,<BR>Each of them had a hundred thousand[3]<BR>in land and linked 
  rings; nor at less price reckoned<BR>mid-earth men such mighty deeds!<BR>And 
  to Eofor he gave his only daughter<BR>in pledge of grace, the pride of his 
  home. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Such is the feud, the foeman's rage,<BR>death-hate 
  of men: so I deem it sure<BR>that the Swedish folk will seek us home<BR>for 
  this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,<BR>when once they learn 
  that our warrior leader<BR>lifeless lies, who land and hoard<BR>ever defended 
  from all his foes,<BR>furthered his folk's weal, finished his course<BR>a 
  hardy hero. -- Now haste is best,<BR>that we go to gaze on our Geatish 
  lord,<BR>and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings<BR>to the funeral pyre. No 
  fragments merely<BR>shall burn with the warrior. Wealth of jewels,<BR>gold 
  untold and gained in terror,<BR>treasure at last with his life 
  obtained,<BR>all of that booty the brands shall take,<BR>fire shall eat it. No 
  earl must carry<BR>memorial jewel. No maiden fair<BR>shall wreathe her neck 
  with noble ring:<BR>nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,<BR>oft shall she 
  pass o'er paths of exile<BR>now our lord all laughter has laid aside,<BR>all 
  mirth and revel. Many a spear<BR>morning-cold shall be clasped 
  amain,<BR>lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp<BR>those warriors wake; but the 
  wan-hued raven,<BR>fain o'er the fallen, his feast shall praise<BR>and boast 
  to the eagle how bravely he ate<BR>when he and the wolf were wasting the 
  slain." </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he told his sorrowful tidings,<BR>and little[4] 
  he lied, the loyal man<BR>of word or of work. The warriors rose;<BR>sad, they 
  climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,<BR>went, welling with tears, the wonder to 
  view.<BR>Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,<BR>their lifeless lord, 
  who had lavished rings<BR>of old upon them. Ending-day<BR>had dawned on the 
  doughty-one; death had seized<BR>in woful slaughter the Weders' king.<BR>There 
  saw they, besides, the strangest being,<BR>loathsome, lying their leader 
  near,<BR>prone on the field. The fiery dragon,<BR>fearful fiend, with flame 
  was scorched.<BR>Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures<BR>in length as it 
  lay. Aloft erewhile<BR>it had revelled by night, and anon come 
  back,<BR>seeking its den; now in death's sure clutch<BR>it had come to the end 
  of its earth-hall joys.<BR>By it there stood the stoups and jars;<BR>dishes 
  lay there, and dear-decked swords<BR>eaten with rust, as, on earth's lap 
  resting,<BR>a thousand winters they waited there.<BR>For all that heritage 
  huge, that gold<BR>of bygone men, was bound by a spell,[5]<BR>so the 
  treasure-hall could be touched by none<BR>of human kind, -- save that Heaven's 
  King,<BR>God himself, might give whom he would,<BR>Helper of Heroes, the hoard

  <P>A PERILOUS path, it proved, he[1] trod<BR>who heinously hid, that hall 
  within,<BR>wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed<BR>one of a few,[2] and 
  the feud was avenged<BR>in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,<BR>what manner a 
  man of might and valor<BR>oft ends his life, when the earl no longer<BR>in 
  mead-hall may live with loving friends.<BR>So Beowulf, when that barrow's 
  warden<BR>he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not<BR>in what wise he 
  should wend from the world at last.<BR>For[3] princes potent, who placed the 
  gold,<BR>with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,<BR>so that marked with sin 
  the man should be,<BR>hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,<BR>racked with 
  plagues, who should rob their hoard.<BR>Yet no greed for gold, but the grace 
  of heaven,<BR>ever the king had kept in view.[4]</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:--<BR>"At the 
  mandate of one, oft warriors many<BR>sorrow must suffer; and so must 
  we.<BR>The people's-shepherd showed not aught<BR>of care for our counsel, king 
  beloved!<BR>That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,<BR>but let 
  him lie where he long had been<BR>in his earth-hall waiting the end of the 
  world,<BR>the hest of heaven. -- This hoard is ours<BR>but grievously gotten; 
  too grim the fate<BR>which thither carried our king and lord.<BR>I was within 
  there, and all I viewed,<BR>the chambered treasure, when chance allowed 
  me<BR>(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)<BR>under the earth-wall. 
  Eager, I seized<BR>such heap from the hoard as hands could bear<BR>and 
  hurriedly carried it hither back<BR>to my liege and lord. Alive was he 
  still,<BR>still wielding his wits. The wise old man<BR>spake much in his 
  sorrow, and sent you greetings<BR>and bade that ye build, when he breathed no 
  more,<BR>on the place of his balefire a barrow high,<BR>memorial mighty. Of 
  men was he<BR>worthiest warrior wide earth o'er<BR>the while he had joy of his 
  jewels and burg.<BR>Let us set out in haste now, the second time<BR>to see and 
  search this store of treasure,<BR>these wall-hid wonders, -- the way I show 
  you, --<BR>where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill<BR>at broad-gold and 
  rings. Let the bier, soon made,<BR>be all in order when out we come,<BR>our 
  king and captain to carry thither<BR>-- man beloved -- where long he shall 
  bide<BR>safe in the shelter of sovran God."<BR>Then the bairn of Weohstan bade 
  command,<BR>hardy chief, to heroes many<BR>that owned their homesteads, hither 
  to bring<BR>firewood from far -- o'er the folk they ruled --<BR>for the 
  famed-one's funeral. " Fire shall devour<BR>and wan flames feed on the 
  fearless warrior<BR>who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,<BR>when, sped from 
  the string, a storm of arrows<BR>shot o'er the shield-wall: the shaft held 
  firm,<BR>featly feathered, followed the barb."<BR>And now the sage young son 
  of Weohstan<BR>seven chose of the chieftain's thanes,<BR>the best he found 
  that band within,<BR>and went with these warriors, one of eight,<BR>under 
  hostile roof. In hand one bore<BR>a lighted torch and led the way.<BR>No lots 
  they cast for keeping the hoard<BR>when once the warriors saw it in 
  hall,<BR>altogether without a guardian,<BR>lying there lost. And little they 
  mourned<BR>when they had hastily haled it out,<BR>dear-bought treasure! The 
  dragon they cast,<BR>the worm, o'er the wall for the wave to take,<BR>and 
  surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.<BR>Then the woven gold on a wain was 
  laden --<BR>countless quite! -- and the king was borne,<BR>hoary hero, to 
  Hrones-Ness. </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><EM><SMALL>[1] Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard. 
    Ten Brink and Gering assume that the dragon is meant. "Hid" may well mean 
    here "took while in hiding."<BR>[2] That is "one and a few others." But 
    Beowulf seems to be indicated. [3] Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen 
    character of this part of the epic. Beowulf's end came, so the old tradition 
    ran, from his unwitting interference with spell-bound treasure.<BR>[4] A 
    hard saying, variously interpreted. In any case, it is the somewhat clumsy 
    effort of the Christian poet to tone down the heathenism of his material by 
    an edifying observation.</SMALL></EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>XLIII </P>
  <P>THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats<BR>firm on the earth a 
  funeral-pile,<BR>and hung it with helmets and harness of war<BR>and 
  breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;<BR>and they laid amid it the mighty 
  chieftain,<BR>heroes mourning their master dear.<BR>Then on the hill that 
  hugest of balefires<BR>the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose<BR>black over 
  blaze, and blent was the roar<BR>of flame with weeping (the wind was 
  still),<BR>till the fire had broken the frame of bones,<BR>hot at the heart. 
  In heavy mood<BR>their misery moaned they, their master's death.<BR>Wailing 
  her woe, the widow[1] old,<BR>her hair upbound, for Beowulf's death<BR>sung in 
  her sorrow, and said full oft<BR>she dreaded the doleful days to 
  come,<BR>deaths enow, and doom of battle,<BR>and shame. -- The smoke by the 
  sky was devoured.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The folk of the Weders fashioned there<BR>on the 
  headland a barrow broad and high,<BR>by ocean-farers far descried:<BR>in ten 
  days' time their toil had raised it,<BR>the battle-brave's beacon. Round 
  brands of the pyre<BR>a wall they built, the worthiest ever<BR>that wit could 
  prompt in their wisest men.<BR>They placed in the barrow that precious 
  booty,<BR>the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,<BR>hardy heroes, 
  from hoard in cave, --<BR>trusting the ground with treasure of earls,<BR>gold 
  in the earth, where ever it lies<BR>useless to men as of yore it was.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then about that barrow the battle-keen 
  rode,<BR>atheling-born, a band of twelve,<BR>lament to make, to mourn their 
  king,<BR>chant their dirge, and their chieftain honor.<BR>They praised his 
  earlship, his acts of prowess<BR>worthily witnessed: and well it is<BR>that 
  men their master-friend mightily laud,<BR>heartily love, when hence he 
  goes<BR>from life in the body forlorn away. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus made their mourning the men of 
  Geatland,<BR>for their hero's passing his hearth-companions:<BR>quoth that of 
  all the kings of earth,<BR>of men he was mildest and most beloved,<BR>to his 
  kin the kindest, keenest for praise. </P>
  <P><EM><SMALL>[1] Nothing is said of Beowulf's wife in the poem, but Bugge 
  surmises that Beowulf finally accepted Hygd's offer of kingdom and hoard, and, 
  as was usual, took her into the bargain. </SMALL></EM></P>
