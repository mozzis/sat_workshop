DHTML - Rollover Effects
==========================
Last Updated: Oct.22,1999.


SUMMARY
========
In this example there are seven SPAN elements, initially set to use the class Item.
When the mouse pointer moves over any one of those elements, the element will be changed to use 
the class Highlight. 

  
DETAILS
========
Innovations in Microsoft® Internet Explorer 4 and 5 enable the following functionality: 


 - Events can now be generated from a SPAN element. Previously, an HTML author 
   would have had to wrap each SPAN element in an anchor to get the right events. 

 - With event bubbling, events can be captured at the document level. You do not 
   need to create separate event handlers for each element that will participate 
   in the effect. 


USAGE
========
Move the cursor over any of the seven elements to change their style.


BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
Dynamic HTML is supported in Internet Explorer 4 and Internet Explorer 5.
