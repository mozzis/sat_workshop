DHTML Behaviors Library - SoundRollover
========================================
Last Updated: Oct.14,1999


SUMMARY
========
The soundRollover behavior provides a script-free method for web page authors 
to add sound effects to elements to make them respond to mouse interaction. 
In the past, some web sites have used Java applets to create rollover sound 
effects because Java provides a sound API. This behavior allows a similar 
effect without the need for code.    


USAGE
======
The soundRollover behavior allows Web authors to specify an audio source to 
be played when the mouse cursor hovers over an element, or when the element 
is clicked.   

 
BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
Behaviors are supported in Internet Explorer 5 for the Win32 and Unix platforms. 
Any browser that doesn't support behaviors will ignore them.
