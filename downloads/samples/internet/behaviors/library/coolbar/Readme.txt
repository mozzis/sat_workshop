DHTML Behaviors Library - Coolbar
====================================
Last Updated: Oct.14,1999


SUMMARY
========
This behavior implements an Explorer-style toolbar.


USAGE
======
The coolbar behavior inserts an Explorer-style toolbar into a Web page. 
Toolbars are a familiar interface for users, and the coolbar behavior applies 
similar effects such as a 3-D border, colored text, and images. Buttons can 
be added easily with the coolbutton behavior, which includes the same effects 
as the coolbar as well as ToolTips.

 
BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
Behaviors are supported in Internet Explorer 5 for the Win32 and Unix platforms. 
Any browser that doesn't support behaviors will ignore them.
